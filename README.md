## 📖 About Project Euler

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems designed to require more than just mathematical insights to solve. While mathematics helps in finding elegant solutions, computer programming skills are essential for solving most problems.

**Key Features:**
- Problems range in difficulty from easy to extremely challenging
- Solving problems often introduces new mathematical and programming concepts
- Great way to develop problem-solving skills in a fun, recreational context
- Over 1.3 million registered members worldwide

## 🚀 My Project Euler Journey

This repository contains my solutions to Project Euler problems as I work through them. I'm using this as an opportunity to:
